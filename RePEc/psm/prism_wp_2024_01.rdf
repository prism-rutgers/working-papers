Title: The EITC and Health Across the Life Course: A Scoping Review
Abstract: Reduction of poverty among children may have significant long-run benefits. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is the largest federal anti-poverty program in the United States and a large body of evidence demonstrates beneficial impacts on family income, employment, and wealth. Research has also found positive effects of EITC exposure on health and social outcomes. However, there is limited understanding of the extent to which exposure to the EITC in early life affects long-run health. We conducted a scoping review to examine the current state of the evidence on the relationship between EITC exposure and health and social outcomes, and mapped that evidence to the broader literature on long-run health impacts across the life course. We searched the literature through August 2024, and focused on methodologically-strong studies (quasi-experimental or randomized trials). Results are presented across the stages of the life course, including infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. We discuss key gaps found.
